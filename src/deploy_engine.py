Not Ready.

# --- !! IMPORTANT TENSORRT NOTE !! ---
# TensorRT executables created with PyInstaller have a major dependency:
# The target machine MUST have the correct NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit,
# and TensorRT runtime libraries installed system-wide that are compatible
# with the engine file and the TensorRT Python library version used.
# PyInstaller bundles the Python code and the .engine file, NOT the core
# TensorRT runtime itself.
